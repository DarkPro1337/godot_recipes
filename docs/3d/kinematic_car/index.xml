      <title>3D Kinematic Car: Base</title>

      <description>Problem You&amp;rsquo;re looking to make a 3D driving or racing game and don&amp;rsquo;t know where to start.
Solution  div.notices.note p:first-child:after { content: &#39;Note&#39;!important; }  Even in 3D, cars tend to remain on the ground. For this reason, movement can (mostly) be treated as if it were 2D. Much of the car&amp;rsquo;s movement code will be very much like the 2D: Car Steering recipe. It&amp;rsquo;s recommended that you review that recipe before proceeding with this one.</description>

      <title>3D Kinematic Car: Traction/Drifting</title>
      <link>https://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/3d/kinematic_car/car_traction/</link>

      <guid>https://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/3d/kinematic_car/car_traction/</guid>
      <description>Problem You&amp;rsquo;ve got a kinematic car, but you don&amp;rsquo;t like the &amp;ldquo;on rails&amp;rdquo; feeling, especially at high speeds. You&amp;rsquo;d like to have some &amp;ldquo;slip&amp;rdquo; so that you can have drifting and loss of traction.
Solution When the car is drifting, the heading of the car (the direction it&amp;rsquo;s pointing) may not be the same as its velocity (the direction it&amp;rsquo;s moving). Turning the wheel will make the car turn, but the velocity will not instantly &amp;ldquo;catch up&amp;rdquo; - instead, we&amp;rsquo;ll use lerp() (linear interpolation) to gradually move the velocity to the desired direction.</description>

      <title>3D Kinematic Car: Chase Camera</title>
      <link>https://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/3d/kinematic_car/car_camera/</link>

      <description>Problem You want a &amp;ldquo;chase camera&amp;rdquo; that can follow your car (or any other object).
Solution  div.notices.note p:first-child:after { content: &#39;Note&#39;!important; }  Godot has a built-in InterpolatedCamera node that does most of what&amp;rsquo;s described here. However, we&amp;rsquo;re not going to use it for two reasons: first, it has a tendency to stutter when following kinematic bodies, and second, it&amp;rsquo;s getting removed in Godot 4.0. Setting up our own is really easy though, so don&amp;rsquo;t worry.</description>

      <title>3D Kinematic Car: Slopes &amp; Ramps</title>

      <description>Problem Your Kinematic Car climbs slopes, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look quite right:
Solution Kinematic bodies don&amp;rsquo;t automatically rotate on collision. When the wheels aren&amp;rsquo;t both touching the ground, as in the image above, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to align the car manually.
To begin, we need to detect when the wheel isn&amp;rsquo;t on the ground. Add two RayCast nodes to the car and align them with the front and rear wheels like so:</description>
